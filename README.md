# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Power-BI
This project involves analyzing customer churn data to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Using Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard that visualizes various aspects of the dataset, providing actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

Key Insights:

Customer Demographics: Understanding the distribution of gender, senior citizen status, and dependents among customers.
Subscription Analysis: Examining the impact of tenure, phone service, internet service, and additional services (Streaming TV, Movies) on customer retention.
Billing Insights: Analyzing billing preferences (paperless billing, payment methods) and their correlation with churn rates.
Support Tickets: Investigating the relationship between administrative and technical tickets and customer churn.
Churn Factors: Identifying the primary factors contributing to customer churn, enabling targeted retention strategies.

Technologies Used:

Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Excel for data preparation and initial analysis.

The insights gained from this analysis provide a solid foundation for developing targeted strategies to reduce customer churn. By understanding customer behavior and preferences, we can enhance our service offerings and improve overall customer satisfaction.
